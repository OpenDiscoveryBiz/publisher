# Service Manager
Allows business professionals to create and edit business service descriptions for their business entities. This will be equivalent to posting business profile data, product catalogues, and related information on a marketplace or sharing platform. The resulting JSON data may be hosted directly by the Service Manager or exported for subsequent upload to the business entity's own web servers.

When ready for beta-use, an implementation of the Service Manager will be made freely available as a service at [OpenDiscovery.biz](https://opendiscovery.biz)

The Service Manager is one of several components needed to enable Distributed Business Service Discovery scenarios.

These components are currently under initial development and we welcome collaboration on the further development of scope and principles (Contact: [Henrik Biering](mailto:hb@peercraft.com)) as well as the technical implementation (Contact: [Casper Biering](mailto:cb@peercraft.com)).

Please refer to the 'devel' branch until a properly working version of the code is available.
